/// The computation of the [IntersectionMatrix] relies on the use of a
/// structure called a "topology graph". The topology graph contains nodes and
/// edges corresponding to the nodes and line segments of a [Geometry]. Each
/// node and edge in the graph is labeled with its topological location
/// relative to the source geometry.
///
/// Note that there is no requirement that points of self-intersection be a
/// vertex.  Thus to obtain a correct topology graph, [Geometry] must be
/// self-noded before constructing their graphs.
///
/// Two fundamental operations are supported by topology graphs:
///   - Computing the intersections between all the edges and nodes of a single graph
///   - Computing the intersections between the edges and nodes of two different graphs
